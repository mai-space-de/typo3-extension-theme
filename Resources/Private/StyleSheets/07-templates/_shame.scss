//
// The "shame file" — a designated holding area for temporary hacks, quick-fixes,
// and styles that don't yet belong anywhere. Every entry here must carry a
// comment explaining why it exists and a ticket/issue reference.
//
// Rules for using this file:
//   1. Every entry needs a comment explaining the reasoning.
//   2. Every entry must carry a reference: // TODO: #123 — move to _button.scss
//   3. Review and clean up the contents of this file regularly.
//   4. If a fix survives two sprints it deserves a permanent home.

// This file is intentionally left empty.
// Add temporary workarounds here and move them to the proper partial as soon
// as the underlying issue is resolved.
